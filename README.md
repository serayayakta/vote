# vote counter

This app encourages citizens to participate in the vote counting process that happens after 5 pm on election day.

The reliability in counting may increase only by showing up and this requires no prior effort.

Ps. There are still updates required like input checks, however, it still works as expected and is still way more reliable and practical than using pen&paper or the notes app on the phone. 

Wishing for the best in the elections <3
